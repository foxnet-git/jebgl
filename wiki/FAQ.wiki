=== Does JebGL work with Mesa for graphics cards that don't support OpenGL ===
It does! But performance is what you'd expect. Anything with a lot of shader action isn't going to run well.

=== Some of the texture images don't load ===
The texture images are actually loaded by the applet. It grabs the URL from the DOM element, and then loads it separately. There is still some development needed for retries, etc.

=== The applet never starts after I reload the page ===
This bug should be fixed. Please let us know otherwise.

= Linux =
=== class not found com.iola.JebGL ===
This error occurs when using the icedtea-plugin Java plugin. You need to switch to Suns Java plugin instead.

=== There's a gray box where the applet should be in Chrome ===
There's an issue with setting applet permissions in Chrome on Linux. If you set _always allow_ the applet wont subsequently load. Until this is fixed you can use _run once_.

= Windows =
=== LessonXX doesn't work in IE6 ===
Some of the lessons still need to be ported to IE6. The errors are with the js, not JebGL.
