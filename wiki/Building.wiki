#summary Instructions for building JebGL from the source code.
#labels Featured

= Get the source =
However you want to deploy JebGL you need the latest code
{{{
svn checkout http://jebgl.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ jebgl-read-only
}}}
or a release (e.g. 0.1)
{{{
svn checkout http://jebgl.googlecode.com/svn/releases/0.1/ jebgl-read-only
}}}

= Building JebGL (using remote jars from jogamp.org) =
== Get jars from jogamp.org ==
{{{
mkdir -p jogl/build/jar
cd jogl/build/jar
wget http://jogamp.org/deployment/webstart/jogl.all.jar
wget http://jogamp.org/deployment/webstart/nativewindow.all.jar
wget http://jogamp.org/deployment/webstart/gluegen-rt.jar
}}}
== Build JebGL ==
{{{
cd ../../../jebgl-read-only
make
}}}
You should now have a jebgl.jar in your current directory.
== Testing your build ==
{{{
cd test
python -m SimpleHTTPServer 1080
}}}
and point your browser to http://localhost:1080/test.html

= Building JebGL (with all jars local) =
== Get Applet Launcher ==
While you don't need [http://java.net/projects/applet-launcher applet-launcher] to build JebGL, you need it for testing your build. Run the following in a terminal:
{{{
svn checkout https://svn.java.net/svn/applet-launcher~svn/trunk applet-launcher
cd applet-launcher
ant
cd ..
}}}

== Get JOGL ==
You need some jars from the JOGL project. You can download JOGL [http://jogamp.org/deployment/webstart/archive/ here]. You need both jogl and gluegen, e.g. `jogl-v2.0-rc2.tar.xz` and `gluegen-v2.0-rc2.tar.xz`. The build instructions are as follows (they may not be up to date, check [http://jogamp.org/jogl/doc/HowToBuild.html JOGL's page] for reference). Open a terminal and run the following:
{{{
xzcat jogl-v2.0-rc2.tar.xz | tar x
xzcat gluegen-v2.0-rc2.tar.xz | tar x
ln -s jogl-v2.0-rc2 jogl
ln -s gluegen-v2.0-rc2 gluegen
cd jogl/make
ant
}}}
If the build is successful the finished jars will be in the `jogl/build/jar` directory.

== Build ==
Open a terminal and call
{{{
make
}}}
in the `jebgl-read-only` directory. This should build a jar file called `jebgl.jar`

== Testing ==
See [http://code.google.com/p/jebgl/wiki/Testing Testing]
